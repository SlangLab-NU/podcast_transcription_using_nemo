hell zach good afternoon man's nick you be can hear me i hear you it's blessed man peak season over here it's pretty crazy although not going to lie how about you n complaints on myend good man good man yeah i wanted to check in see how business is going see if you're h kind of in a place to start taking on some of the clients on the home stars network oh yeah man peak season we got the victoria day discount going on right now tt to give you a buzz and see where you're at that's fair that's fair i appre i appreciate the h the courtesy call um thank youbout that yeah like i said before man i don't i don't think i can go do that like work for somebody else and be thinking like i'm working for myself like that's i don't know it's kind of a different way to do it you know what i mean and i'm not really down to do something like that i'd rather just do what i'm doing and uh figure it out like that you know what i mean 'cause technically i'd be working for somebody else no not really you're working for yourself we're just sending you clients that come to us well a lot of no no no hear me out though last time we were talking though you're you're going on about how there's there's these guys h that um do this and do that and they're smoking on the property which i understand where you're coming from completely i do um they shouldn't be smoking on the property that's not professional by any means um but and then you you were saying about like oh yeah well we had to have a chat with them it's like bro like what's not really yours you know what i mean like so like i'm i'm sitting there like okay well if that's the case i'm not really down to do something like that because like i i pissed in the wrong corner you know what you' gonna have a fucking chat with me i don't think so dude like that's not how shit works in my you know what i mean like i ain't trying to answer h in that case you know what i mean like i i answer to people but that's not how how i'm doing it no it's not like that what i'm saying is like if you want to be successful here i don't forget the conversation i think you might forget the conversation we had no i dude it's all good man regardless it's all good you guys got a system and i respect that you know i respect that man don't get it twisted so like okay like what i'm what i'm trying to i don't understand so you're saying like you're gonna be doing that stuff like we i'm not going to be no i'm not saying i'm goinga do any of that stuff i'm just saying like like the point of the home stars deal is people come to us to find professionals who are top of their craft they're verified they're reviewed right and we want to put our names behind good companies right ideally we don't want to put our name behind someone who's unprofessional who's you know not giving the homeowner a good experience like that's our first priority right is giving the homeowner a good experience and like we hundred percent like that should be number one at the end of the day you know what i mean like that that's like i'll go above and beyond some days where i'm sitting there i'm like fuck man i didn't put this in a quote whatever ill ust do it you know what i mean 'cause like at the end of the day you know nine times out of ten you do that they're gonna call you back you know what i mean so it's it it it's always that repertoire you're thinking of about tomorrow you're not just thinking about right now okay i'm gonna make uh three hundred dollars on this job no you're thinking okay i'll make three hundred dollars on this job you do an extra this or that maybe you'll get the neighbor to do some stuff you you you gotta think down the road long term you know what i mean like some people like you're saying the ones who just smoke on the fucking property and do all this bullshit they're not thinking like that but like at the same time like if for instance for instance i'll  i had a client get me a reference like multiple times it's happened to me but like anyways they got me a reference and they got me another client from that now if i was to do a bunch of bullshit that client that got me the client they they're not gonn to pick up the phone and and be like whoa what blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and if they were they they would have rude awakening but you know what you feel where i'm coming from thog now i yeah i was s like we don't call of m bro we're noting these people if they call it us like for example like the story that i told you we had a guy show up to a quote to a quote  you're showing up to a quote bro you're trying to win a job and you're doing everything in your power to give the homeowner the all the reason to be like hey like you kind of some scruffy like you got to think like broke the sometimes think sometimes ust com fro oobs you got to like you just got to roll at the punches and tell me hey i just finished the job like and i want the job t all dirty like you know what i mean like that's fine like i mean that's  i mean man oh i ior shit it got worked that's expected but like if you show up you're rude you smell like liquor you're you know smoking on the property like listen most people don't care about smoking like it's not like a crazy thing but like how you present yourself and then if you come back to us and say hey like that person didn't hire us well no shit they didn't hire you bro 'cause the other guy that came after you was clean professional and he looks like he wants to win the job he's done this before you know what i mean like that's not we're not policing you that's not the deal it's your clients there you choose how you get paid you choose the quotes all that stuff we provide you a proven lead system that'll have a healthy flow of clients through your business right that's fair that's fair you know what i mean like you're the one doing the work you're the one setting the jobs you're the one pricing the jobs you're working for yourself this is just a marketing tool like you're paying us to have flow through your business so that you can focus on what's important to you which is actually getting the work done you got your head in marketing accounting in quoting and doing the work like there's so many different avenues that you have to be consumed with and like you're just not going to do the best at all of them right like and to have a successful business that operates that's what you need you need all those things to be clean operating efficiently well yeahah you do and you need you're not wrong you got to start at the bottom in you know what i mean like you've got to build that reputation like part of that too is that you got to be you got to put in your time right you can't just like oh yeah throw money at people be like oh can you can you do this for me like you know what i mean like it's it's easy to do that it's easy to throw money at people like oh yeah go go go figure this out but if you don't actually try to figure it out and you don't actually learn from it then what do you what are you actually doing you're just throwing money away you know what i mean because that money it's no value at that point because like you don't actually know how to do it you don't didn't actually learn anything so like throwing let's say six hundred dollars i it's it's it it becomes worthless you know i meanalk about like home stars aor like paying an account the i'm i'm saying like if you don't actually get to learn or get to do it like you you you're not really succeeding re really thoug you you know what i'm saying 'cause like realistically if you if if i was to put all this money in h getting more clients and all that sure that's great but then that that defeats the whole purpose of what i'm trying to do you know what i mean like so i don't know man like right now i've got no issues putting money into where it is but i gotta understand what it what it's doing you know what i mean like i gotta understand it i gotta i gotta be able to look back and be like okay if i stop putting money into this i can actually turn around and do this myself you know what i mean like that defeats the whole purpose of pan us why would you want to do this that's als if you're not a professional marketer i the one thing like i think you understand well bra like i mean like i understand business fluidly and i'm sure you have a great understanding of business as well like the point of business is to run a business and not let your business run you so you hire people to take on tasks for you right like i'm assuming you want to hire a crew one day right like to do more work but you know eventual be like one thing at a time like i was saying it's one thing at a time and it's not like you can't jump in a fucking deep end before you even learn how to swim if you've got ploys on sure but like you can't just jump in the deep anden you' got to youve got to gradually do it you know like just diving in it's kind of silly you know you got to gradually and then once you start building it from there you know you can say i'm wrong but you know i'm right you know you gotta start if you do this all yourself and you're successful with yourself then you reach out and be like okay you know what i want more let's let's let's go this job and you les get some more you know what i mean but like until you do that well what are you doing really you're just you're just throwing money away because like so you don't believe like you have like the the the the skills or the system to close clients like you haven't gone to that point yet i'm not saying that that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying like right now i'm projecting to make double of what i did last year you know what i'm saying so like if i do that and i make those projections then i'm doing okay you know what i mean because if i make double of what i did last year then right away it's it's okay you know what i'm saying like and i'm not saying any and by any means of the word i mean success that's not what that means the just means that it's one step closer to my ultimate goal which is what do you mean which is what's your ultimate goal well theventually i'm going to have cruise and stuff right be so that's not not for a long time that's for a while ight but i'm still fucking scratching i'm still scratching dude like i told you last time around i went bankrupt not bankrupt by the banks standard but i went broke i had like sixty grand and then i went broke and then i fucking all that bullshit happened it quit my job and i started this and whatever you know what i mean and then went broke again so like i'm not i'm not stressing about that i'm not stressing about money or any of thing like that you know what i mean this is more so trying to figure out if i can do this and and what what i can do what i can tolerate because i know i can tolerate a lot i know i can handle a lot i've been through hell and i'm back you know what i'm saying so like it's it's it's got nothing to do with the money i got all the all the fucking time in the world to figure out who i am and that's what that's what i'm trying to do and once i fucking figure that out and once i do it's all about myself and eventually hire people in to'll go in certain positions like hire 'em full time to work for me and whatnot then you know what i'm saying then i can be like okay well you know what i'm saying but like for the first couple fucking years at least there's gotta be like not necessarily one man show but like i gotta figure all this out you know what i'm saying who sets that rule though like in terms of like it has to be it has to i know what you're trying to do man you're trying to come back to me with a fucking because you you've gota make a sale i i don't know how much money you make on the sale that's irrelevant to me but i know why you're coming back like that dude it's cool dude i'm i'm telling you right now it doesn't matter who does what man i'm telling you right now the way i'm doing it okay that's the way i'm gonna do it man that's that's just how i am if once i put my mind to something that's what how it goes so totally fine look i h i run businesses too and i actually like have gotten them to the point where like i barely have any interaction with them and i make s a year off of it passively almost so i hop maybe help a bit i guess like i i don't care if you sign up for home stars or not it's irrelevant listen i called to see if you were open to it but it's not like oh my god like i need you to sign trust me it's not like that bro but we've had multiple conversations at length like you've told me some personal shit about you bro and likep and like i i get it for a in a sense but anyways man like i genuinely wish you well like i hope you succeed i hope that you know you do hit that goal one day but just be be open to buying people's time 'cause that's how you trickle up to the top in business that's that's from what i've seen in a lot of successful businesses my own business myself the more people's time you buy the more time you have to do the most important things in the business right that's the taking it slow the taking it slow is not make ten thousand put ten thousand in your bank account it's make ten thousand put one thousand in your bank account and nine thousand goes to investment to kind of build the base again it's like pouring concrete poor layer of concrete right or like building a building you got to get that and you know if it's an actual skyscraper you're going down into the ground deep foundation framing from the ground below the ground up constant i don't know o like i don't know much about skyscraper except they're tall yeah i don't know i mean like if you're like a kind of in the industry i thought you'd know but yeah anyways like the we you mean i'm in the industry i'm not in the industry well you're in the home improvement industry like i mean yeah but that come on man that's that's that's a little bit different than a fucking skyscraper you never se you never like driven downtown toronto and like seen people like you never seen like a construction site like dude i avoid toronto like the plague man mm every time andn every time i even like drive through toronto i feel like h claustrophobic 'cause im i'm used to like even like hamilton is getting to that point now like i'm used to like open like h country man like  countryside and like farms and shit that's what i'm used to you know and like come in come in like h i think yeah eighteen i came to hamilton and it was like what the book yeah but anyways aside from like the the the point right like it's just honestly bro if you are making sales i don't know what your your actual situation is right now if you're like floating in jobs or if you're kind of like slow i don't know what it is but if you are making money start trying to allocate it to get like if you have a system like for example let's say this right on the sales side of things if you know you have a system like as a business you should where you got someone calling you and they're interested in working with you should have a system on like oka how long should we wait until we actually like get back to this client do we quote them in person do we quote them online when we do quote them what is the aspects of a quote how much does it actually cost us all these things right once you have that system built you've done that a few times right you know it's a proven system it works hire somebody to do that system for you right triming hedges you build a system how to trim hedges you teach someone you hire them now they trim the hedges for you and then e fiichency starts to pick up instead of doing one job or two jobs a day you can do ten right instead of getting five ten jobs whatever a week maybe you get twenty and it consistently grows in that sense right that's that's what i'm saying in terms of like the actual growth things of it like i don't think you should feel i don't think you should feel bad about having other people doing work for you if you run a business because every big business has employees and the founder sits behind a desk raking in millions of dollars a year yeah you're right but like at the same time except for the last company i worked for the last company the got owner was just a dick ad he got it hand to him from his father but whatever the comp every other company i've worked for you know what i mean like the owner and i've talked to them like cause i'm i was trying to like pick their bank eventu i didn't know you know what i mean i'm just i was just some young punk trying to curious asking questions you know i didn't know eventually i'd have my own but every single one of them started off working on the floor you know what i mean like they'd work more hours than most the employees you know yeah redc like that's a you business right they put their disco and then eventually like now they're they're all a fucking taking flights here and there all over the fucking world man like the one guy he owns i did a dirt job for him and guy fucking owns a golf course and he owns a this fucking dog farm right near it and his house is like five minutes up the road he's like oh yeah i just take my tractor and my h y dump box connect to the tractor and use all my tools and h drive up here get the dirt from here i'm like oh what the fuck like and he's like yeah i just i i own this so i fuckm was like h i gotta pick this guy's brain like so he's he's old money right so his his dad made grandpa made the money and then passed it on to his dad but passed it on to him but he still he knows the business he knows it in the nd like they taught him they didn't just pass the money they taught him um lessons you know what i mean like and that right there is more valuable than than money and that's what i'm trying to get at like you can you can just throw your money at anything and that's one of the major things that that i keep hearing from all these multi like super successful company owners is like you can throw your money at anything and you can pay for anything but if you don't actually learn it then what's the point you know what i mean like because 'cause it's just yeah yeah but it if you if you can't learn it then why you why are you spending your money you know what i mean like then you're just you're just throwing your money away for nothing 'cause yeah it might make you ten times more but at the end of the day like you know what i'm saying yeah man yeah i i think it's h like depending on what your goal is in business right that's kind of the the deal there like if you're trying to make money and something can make you more money then like i don't know i i take that like im i'm not the guy you know what i mean like i will it's a catch twenty two yeah a hundred percent like but at the same time like i want to be able to  one day let's say i got x amount of employees right and in the office i i can go in one day and bum bum bom someone's sick i can go take over for instance you know what i mean or on the jobs that i you know what i mean like i wanta be able to if i need to know every single part of it that's why i want to learn this stuff right now so then later on down the road when i actually hire somebody to do it i don't even need to explain it they already know but i know that if it needs to and i need to do it if i need to fire them or whatever or they need to quit or whatever then i can just take over eventually till i hire somebody else you know what i'm saying like otherwise if you don't do that and you don't um learn it beforehand then they fucking dip or they get fired you're fucked you know so how how would that relate to to marketing then like how are you doing in marketing right now like what's how are you getting clients what's the flow looking like i mean like home stars you'll never have to fire us we'll never quit on you either so like what what is that looking like like i know you said you were doing some like you were testing some smaller ad stuff right like are you just working off of word of mouth right now yeah right now i got word of mouth i got some h lis i got online ads um yeah the got some other mother stuff too like truck and some other stuff you know what i mean like um business cards and what's your c p c right now on the uh the ads like the online ads what do you mean the c p c what does that mean like your cost per click oh that's prett cqlick or even like cost per customer i would have to check that with you i don't know i just i don't know off the top of my head okay that's fair yeah it's something like look into it right 'cause then like depending on like what a avenues you're looking at you know you're you're testing like i get it b like you're a new business money's tight it's h you' gotta obviously like play your cards rights is clients so zero pressure on my  i know i know i'm not h like you just said i'm a small like im i'm fucking tiny compared to some of these fish like some of these fucking guys are sharks man i'm like a little fucking min what is those little yeahn at least a little smaller right now like that's what i mean like its it's technically like my second year doing it nxt you know what i mean i'm just trying to fucking like grow grow grow build my reputation right now and that's the biggest thing man build your reputation that's all i'm trying to do right now because like once i start building that up then i'm good you know what i mean then i know for sure like everything's all good and everything like well right now that's what i'm trying to do but h i don't know it's not it's not necessarily that i'm scared or nothing like that it's just i don't know i kinda i had a plan and like a a platform and i'm trying to follow that platform and it's not even like oh yeah i'm trying to go with you gk you it it's nothing like that man it's just i don't know man and it's not pride it's not pride i can tell you that yeah i don't know what that word means anymre to be honest with you so yeah i i think it's just you know what bro like believe in yourself come to a conclusion maybe you never will and that's obviously like you choose you know how do you think but like if you do we understand maybe i never will i'm saying come to a conclusion that it's ok to hand the wheel to other people for your benefit all right likell that's ok it's actually beneficial for you because if you think about it what is your number one skill right now in your business like what do you provide h i provide a a few different things like i best i thind like this this i think the the my friendliness and how i uh interact with the customers and kinda like i'm make it like one on one you know what i mean so like i i recognize who they are as a person i think that's like 'cause anyone can fucking do the bushes and like cut grass and lace sod and anyone can do all that you know what i mean like well yeah you actually talk to them and like you let them know that you actually care you know what i mean like if they if they tell you something you you're not just like ooh yep yep cool cool so like i'm saying like what in your within your business like what's your best like 'cause that's like you comparing yourself to other companies everyone says the same thing you know customer first we say it you say it the guy just called before you said it like everyone sah but you know as well as i do some people don't actually live by that yeah but you like yeah literally everyone says it so it's like i like i'm asking not like what you'd tell your client i'm asking like honestly as like a business consultant you know that's straight up like i don't tell my clients that i don't tell anybody that and then another thing okay i tell it how it is and it's straight up with people andn if someone tries to fuck me around i'll just look 'm in the eye and like i'll make sure they know i'm not fucking around and i'll walk away like i think that's number one 'cause they know i don't fuck around you know how ho yeah i i i mean i guess my question was more gauged towards like like money making skills like you know you go you didn't say that though yeah so like i'm saying like okay like are you best at marketing are you best at managing you know operations are you best at the actual physical product which is you delivering the lawn care the maintenance like what do you what are you worse thatt those are your two things that you need to know when you're running a business whatever you're best at is double down on that focus hard as fuck on that whatever you're not good at is going to be the bottleneck to you growing as a business and you need to fire someone who is better than you are doing that and that's an ego thing whether you say it or not i had the same shit bro i used to think oh i'm the best at you know x y and z right i can do it i can do it and then i found someone who was ten times better than me it put me to shame hired them changed it yeah but it's not even the ego thing man you can say it's an ego thing all you want man but like it's not like you may think you know me by the conversations we had but like i don't really have an ego man like i'm not talking to you i'm saying it's a general thing but as a busin so yeah but like that's what i mean like it's for some people it's more so like we gotta like get this ball rolling you know what i mean like get it rolling and not down a fucking hill get it rolling on flat ground 'cause anyone can get the ball rolling down a hill man that's that's easy but once you get it rolling on a fucking flat ground then you get somebody come in and fucking help you as it's already in motion you know what i mean yeah that's that's what i'm trying to do right now because like i'm trying to get the ball still in motion and once i get in motion then it's like ok let's get some people help well like it it's nothing to do with an egle thing it's more so like once if i i get this for instance if i bring you guys on  and you guys i'm not saying you won't but let's say you project numbers three times what i'm doing four times five times whatever that's relevant to numbers and and all of a sudden i gotta fuck in hire somebody else right well right away i'm not ready to hire somebody else now i don't know what kind of person this person is potentially right so that brings the whole aspect of i haven't actually given the time to train this person to show this person my way of doing things so now we got so swamped i'm just like okay go take this truck and go to these locations there need this done now i don't know if i'm gonn to get a bunch of phone calls saying okay this this just got a shit job what the fuck man i thought you were good i got a call from this guy saying h you know what i mean like you all of a sudden if i go too fast all of a sudden i might be up shits creek and my business might be zero even though i got all these fucking leads from you guys you know what i mean because you're only good as good as your weakest link and if you can't train your weakest link properly you are not fucking going to make it so that's what my concern is if i fucking build too fast and i hire people and they're not ready that's what my concern is it so that's why i need to slowly do this that i can train them properly and and eventually get those people who are trained properly train people properly and then eventually just fucking snowball snowball snowball and then go from there you know what i mean so i know you're sitting there like  you kind of thinking logically about it but like i do i do eventually want to figure someth out but right now is not the time dude hundred percent whenever the time's right is when you'll come on right like i'm not i'm not here to force you into doing something r you know your business at the end of the day like i'm i'm personally like i'm clinically obsessed with business you know what i mean you im wife she gets thirty minutes a day on sched on time stup i swear to god bro you know i'm not even kidding like she gets one full day on saturday that's it like i laria is appreciative of it you know she's like thank you for making me a priority like you know what i mean bro like i don't know so i like talking business i like helping out you know what i mean like i i think you're still at that early stage you're still figuring shit out and that's totally fine right like we're all there at a point and that's the thing i'm just you know wishing you well i know what this platform does for guys that you know obviously do home maintenance sd do home services all that like i see it right like i see it so whenever whenever you're ready brother you know you got my info you got my number and like we can we can chat about a plan um and get you started but don't do it after like unless you're doing anything like anything interior over the winter don't do it after like september like after september you'll you'll you'll waste time oh legitimate i try not to falk interior too much like like i'll do ill i know how to do all that man i know how to do all that shit and i'm not trying to be cocky or anything my dad he was one of those guys he was like you you're gonna learn everything because one day you might have no money and you might need it done i was like oh yeah that makes sense so but i don't like doing that shit because they got enough fucking insured to go in someone's house you know what i mean like that so next h no june third for instance say chlisten man june third i gotta go to fucking back to my one client's house yeah i gotta cut some trees down all this other stuff right and h and then he's like oh yeah when you come back can you can you change some h some fautt i said i know how to like but i agreed to him and i said to him i'm like listen dude i'm not insured so if something breaks or if i break something by accident i'm not a plumber and i'm not insured to do this so he agreed to it all you know what i mean but like at the same time it's still that like yeah like bro if you don't do it then don't don't come on right like because it's very slow for exterior work over the winter months as you can imagine if you come on during the summer right come in competitive package make a shit ton of money then downgrade it all the way down over the winter time very good business model i work with hundreds of guys who do that and you know they eat everybody eats big platform big mu big budget on our end and um yeah this time of year is always like it's like breeding season mating season you know like we're just we're out to kill so yeah anyways dude h good catching up you obviously you have my contact information if you need it and i genuinely wish you all the best good chalk like likewise man likewise
