hello hi harpl how are you ldu good it's jason giving me a call from homestars understand over the weekend you were looking for some information about joining our network and connecting with homeowners for your business to class a plumbing y yeah it is now an okay time to call in know i'm calling a little bit out of the blue i was just hoping to see learn a little bit about your business what you're looking to attract and ours might be a good fit for you okay what what type of work are you looking to attract your profile plumbing you're looking for plumbing work and you're located in the calgary area yeh okay okay happy to help build out a profile page for you and connecting with the with our homeowners do you do you know much h much about home stars or what kind of brought you to requesting some information we don't know about that much okay what did you see thath that kind of encouraged you to request or fill out that form there online okay the like you you you filled out a form right does that h ring any bells i don't understand that yeah you film filled out a form right online to connect with homestars yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so i was curious what like what you were hoping to learn or like what request what encouraged you to fill out that form we want people to call us we need jobs okay so that's why we filled you a form to make ad okay yeah yeah and do you have very much like advertisements online right now i i couldn't h find many details about uh your business online i see h you might have a is the a facebook page that you have yeah yeah we are having facebook page okay yeah and how are you typically connecting with homeowners right now h with the different people like uh electricians or other people give our number to the house owners so we get we get linked with them so we are getting the job by this way okay so a lot of like referrals from other contractors as yeah yah yeah okay i know i know typically in the industry when guys kind of do that they typically like you know get a little bit of a commission fee once once things go through properly is that kind of what you set up with those networks yeh so like every time you get a you know a plumbing project from one of your electricians for example you pay them a fee or a percentage no no they are like old friends we don't pay anything to them we al sort offer for them okay so the al sort of yea okay so it's more of like an exclusively you help them out they help you out and whatnot yeah yeah yeah okay what types of like plumbing projects are you are you mainly working on like are you doing more so like repairs are you doing more so everything everything ok and you guys are fully licensed fully licensed ok bee the reason why why homeowners come on to home stars to begin with is they're looking for registered companies they're looking for guys that are doing quality work that have all of their licenses right so a big part of home stars is that our job is to work with only the right companies for homeowners so we need to find guys that you know can pass a criminal background check have their licenses uh have their h s t or proper insurance is needed as required from the the provincial government um oky ensure that essentially every time that a homeowner uses home stars to find a a service professional that they're connecting with someone that's reliable someone that's safe someone that's doing a quality job okay do do you see kind of like how that would also like build trust with homeowners once they're kind of connecting with uh with your business through our network okay that that makes sense yeah okay so we want to make sure that you are a good fit for home stars to begin with as well right okay what like what exactly kind of like how are you kind of standing out from other other plumbers in calgary we are doing proper job no problem after the plumbing and we finish it overork on time okay so it sounds like youre you're reliable and then doing quality work yehk so so a big part of homes stars it's a review based platform so okay what i mean by that is it's only homeowners that are allowed to leave reviews for you on your page the more positive reviews that you get obviously the more connections and the more leads that you're gonn to close through our network right now typically when i set up pages for my partners we go through and we set up a a few reviews from your past clientele do you do you have clients that you've worked with over the years that would be uh you know that you'd feel confident in in requesting reviews for your page okay uh actually i have uh started in my page recently your what sorry yeah i have j uh started in my page okay on facebook recently it's uh i think h about from one a month you not so long ok and then so with with your home stars page though you think you would be able to get other reviews from from their clients or is that  ok now the way that home stars works is you'll get you'll get connected with leads and job ready homeowners that are looking for those projects based off of how we set up your service areas and also your categories so what what what's your service area that you set up like are you servicing all of calgary or is there certain part of the city that you're focused on no no all of the galgy ok ah all of calgary and then you're doing everything from repair jobs all the way to to major major plumbing instales yeah yeah yeah everything now when did you download the home stars for pro app at all you know are you on an i phone or an android i phone i phone so if you go on to the app store right now and you go through and you search home stars pro ok wait a sec yes home star pro yeah home stars for pros okay so all of your job requests will come through that app once we set up an activate yar profile okay what you'll do is you'll get a service request from a homeowner in two different ways so every time someone requests for you know a plumber near their area as long as you're set up within that service area that it' you know a task that you have selected the lead that you want to be getting for your page you'll get connected with that homeowner what it is important after you get connected is being able to send them a message be responsive give a customer service like you like you mentioned is one of your strong suits and then connect with them you know if they don't answer their message right away you are also able to give them a phone call you know to learn a little bit more about the project and get hired for the service that they're looking for ok now now when you are getting you know your referrals from your friends in your network is there anywhere online for those homeowners to see an example of work that you're doing right now in calgary no ok so that that's another thing that home chars brings its strength for right is every time every time that someone googles your company we want to make sure that they're coming to your home stars page to see the quality of work that you're doing and see the reviews that you have from real clients okay so it's a lot of people use homes stars as a tool to not only close on jobs that you get from home stars but also close on jobs that you get through you know other different advertisements or different you know through word of mouth okay so if you go so you downloaded the app there yeah and what does that kind of show you there i am adjusting no okay i can do yeah i can do that on my end here in the email is it harpaul dot cara at yahoo dot com change it do it one two three oka a gmil dot com okay so that's h a r p a s l k h a r a y one two three at gmil dot com yeah okay and is that the email that you would want homeowners to reach out to you directly aut yeah yeah yeah and and it's h a class plumbing l td is the the official busines a class puming yeah yeah yeah a class plumbing yeh ok bear with me for one moment i'm just setting up your profile page here how long have you been in business for i think my brother is in this business from last ten years oka or and running like a class or running different businesses a class okay so ten years so you have quite a like a good reputation in calgary yeah he was working with someone from last uh ten years but h from uh i think two years he haarts his own business now okay and what is the what's the business address for you guys like where are you located uh two o three two zero three homestead drive yep northeast so that's t j ir t s j for a nine e th j twod six oka so while i'm getting this set up on my  so you mentioned kind of all of calgary is is your main service area right like do you go further outside calgary depending on the projects or wanting to go ou ok and what is what's the average cost you have like a job minimum like what that you go for for like emergency repairs or what does that look like on your end it depends on the situation oka yeah so if you go if you can use your your email i just set up the profile page for you oka so your gmail address okay and then use the the temporary password homes stars oka let me know if you can log into the app there ok what's the password homes starsh yes once yeah try home stars all lower case okay okay none okay so that will bring you in it'll bring you through you don't have to set it up right now but i'll go through once we set up and upgrade your profile w'll walk you through setting up your pro profile adding in your logo adding the services that you have and then sending out a few review requests before we do do that we just need to go through and set up a few more details on to your page so what like the way that home stars works is it's a daynamic program based off of how busy you want to be so every contractor that i bring on like i mentioned before is it's a twelve month period making sure that you are around doing able to do the business that you say that you're able to do as well oky we set it up based off of the service area and then the categories make up what your monthly price is oky so the monthly price there's different tiers and it depends on how busy you want to be and typically that's set up also by how big your team is like do you do you have a lot of guys that work for you or is it mainly just you yourself and your brother now we are doing both we both ot of wking ok but you don't have another team like you don't have any other crews it's mostly just your brother and yourself yeah okay so if you go ont just on to like a web browser so just on to safari or to google chrome go to homes stars dot com okay and then do you see where it says browse categories at the topary yeah just homestars dot com yeh and then let me know what you see there get it measured we los for your next home project perfect so yeah that that's that's the general service request that a homeowner's putting in they'll put in the service that they need their location what their timeline is so maybe it's an emergency maybe they're looking for something to be done within two weeks and then you'll be able to connect with them accordingly right ye we get about three thousand service requests come through every day i wish they were all in plumbing but but overall on the on the network we're the the biggest network in cal in calgary and canada for homeowners finding pros for their projects okay so if you if you scroll down do you see on the sorry on the top left with the menu the three lines yeah yeah you can click on that and you can click browse categories okay and then on the search function on the top right you can search plumbing and search calgary just to give you an idea of of other companies that are using us in the area okay yeah menton drain cleaning tb plumbing heating yep okay yes do you recognize any of these companies no worries if you don't just depends on no i don't crak so do you see where at the top of the where it says sort order if you sort it by recently reviewed just want to walk you through a few of the recent projects coming through were to click sorry so if you're at the top of the page yeah you'll see a it says sort right under plumbing in calgary it'll say sort order and it'll give you average customer rating star score yeah ok ok so hit recently reviewed recently reviewed ok yeah and then just for exam like if you scroll down like one do you see pete the plumber which plumber pete the plumber p e t e no ok so you will see slightly different list mainly because i'm located in a different area but also what i want you to do is pick a company that wait a sec go yep okay so you ca like you're you're still looking at the list of companies right yeh why why don't you pick one that kind of stands out to you like try to pick someone that has you know above ten reviews but you know less than five le less than a hundred okay sixty three reviews floor master mechanicals floor master flow master in therea are youa searching you just open up here yeah i have seen bdub oka oh flow flow mat flowmster floor slow flow flow oka yeah you can you can open up the flowmster mechanical that's a good one to look at okay no they're not active on the platform right now so they've they used they're still with us but they're binly using us just to host some of their reviews from years ago as well as the home stars verified badge so that shows that they're a verified contractor but they if these were my partners i'd be wondering why they're not getting any recent reviews because they're probably not closing a lot of projects come through so if you yeah if you go back and you hit you do pete the plumber ok plumba yeah because i know he had some recent reviews and he also has a few awards with us as well reviews a very god yeah so so after after being on the platform for a year then you're eligible for awards so every january every january we give out awards for the previous year so between now and january if you're able to get at least twelve reviews and there you maintain a ninety percent star score that's when you'll get the award for this year as well ok and then that gives kind of more more accreditation to your business right when you're connecting with more homeowners okay but now then you can see the reviews what types of projects that they're getting so jerry helped with jerry and pete helped with with clogging of a drain so you can read a little bit about the service that they had completed and then the job price in blue at the bottom of the review that will give you the total price for the service that they completed ok so so for example even if the review that's below that they actually didn't have a good service so they rated one out of ten theyay they paid five hundred dollars for that service but we want to make sure you know it's ok it's inevitable to get negative reviews every once in a while we just want positive reviews to overshow and b and be the more consistent right ok but you'll see you'll see very much like you know smaller service calls that are you know between the three hundred and five hundred dollar mark and you'll see larger projects come through like five thousand dollars fifteen dollars and whatnot so it depends on the the process and your ability to execute and close on the lead that you get through home stars as well ok how does that sound any any questions is that something seem like something that would help your business grow no no no questions ok so it's more so just setting up the right package for you then right yeah ok so so the monthly price for home stars like i said is dependent on how busy you want to be ok what i would recommend because it's the two of you is set it up based off of you know either our entry level roughly our entry level package so if you sign up today do you have a little bit left over from a discount that we're running for the victoria day long weekend ok which is twenty five percent off ok so the cost of thisan so on the plan it's normally four hundred and eighty dollars a month ok with the twenty five percent off you're looking at three hundred and sixty dollars a month okay so approx how many job we get in a month uh so it depends on how how you're able to close on the jobs that you do get through the mon the the program right uh i can give you some ideas of how many leave that we're getting yep uh bear with me for one moment here while i pull that up so i'm looking on average my plumbers are seeing about eight to twelve leads come through a month through the network this is one of the recent leads that came through yesterday so the the the homeowner living in a detached home they're looking to start the project within a month and the details about the project is that they're looking to install a shower toilet and sink in the basement room next to the water and sewer lines so so this is someone more of a larger project as well what i also really like which is actually new to this year is we've added home stars badges so you can actually see through the app once a homeowner has used home stars in the past so if they're like free if they're a frequent user of home stars if they've hired pros on our network before ok they've hired pros and also if they've recently written written a review you'll see those details of the homeowner so you you know that they're a little bit you know you can classify them as a little hotter than you know maybe someone that's using home stars for the first time oka that makes sense yeah now how does that kind of all make sense to you uh in terms of getting set up today like is this something that you want to go forward and we can activate the profile page today uh actually right now i am at the job okay so i think in the evening i will uh take your subscription or uh check out uh your plans yep so so the plans are are just like i i mentioned there before right um there're there's so four hundred and eighty is is the base price if you're ready to go through today i can do that twenty five percent off so yeah so so what we can do is we can like i work basically nine to five okay you can give me a text message if you want to get this set up today and then ya i am about three pm okay you want me to give you a call in a couple at three p m yeah okay i'll do that then okay we'll talk soon let me know if you have any questions okay okay thanks sir paul appreciate it thank you
