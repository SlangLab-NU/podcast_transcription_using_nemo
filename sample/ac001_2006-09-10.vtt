00:06.260 --> 00:09.281
Astronomycast, episode one for Monday, September 11, 2006.

00:11.401 --> 00:12.862
Pluto and Planethood.

00:15.622 --> 00:17.363
Welcome to the Astronomycast.

00:17.443 --> 00:21.604
My name is Fraser Cain and I am the Webmaster of Universe today.

00:21.624 --> 00:28.645
And I also have with me Pamela Gay, also from Slacker Astronomy fame.

00:29.326 --> 00:31.026
And are you there, Pamela?

00:31.830 --> 00:32.351
I am here.

00:32.651 --> 00:33.091
All right.

00:33.872 --> 00:35.893
I wasn't sure I'd be talking to myself but no that's good.

00:37.895 --> 00:44.880
So we're our hope with this brand new show and you'll have to you know watch us as we go through our teething pain.

00:44.900 --> 00:56.449
As our hope is to cover some of the latest highlights in astronomy news but more did kind of deeper into the background and

00:57.149 --> 01:02.814
sort of the underlying explanations of the world of astronomy, a universe of astronomy.

01:03.775 --> 01:11.482
And so not just kind of like what's been discovered, what's going on, but actually to say, you know, like how do we know what we know?

01:12.182 --> 01:13.964
and trying to get some underlying explanations.

01:14.004 --> 01:30.157
And hopefully week after week as we build up an archive of shows, people can kind of look back and when they know about, say, black holes or dark matter, they can listen to some of our shows on those exact subjects and really kind of understand the subject matter a little better.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.039
Do you agree, Pamela?

01:32.808 --> 01:33.929
I totally agree.

01:34.009 --> 01:46.378
We're going to follow the facts through the cosmos and find out where the facts lead us and look at what the facts were initially, what we thought initially and what we know now and what we think these facts that we know now tell us.

01:47.355 --> 01:55.181
So if we, if we talk to any astronomer, anyone in the space industry this last couple of months and said, you know, look, what's the, what's the hot story?

01:56.102 --> 01:57.923
They'll all tell us it's Pluto.

01:58.023 --> 01:58.924
Pluto, Pluto, Pluto.

01:59.404 --> 02:02.507
In fact, you know, every question that I got was about Pluto.

02:02.547 --> 02:03.908
Pluto, a planet is not a planet.

02:04.208 --> 02:04.909
What does that mean?

02:05.489 --> 02:05.769
What's it?

02:05.869 --> 02:06.550
What is a planet?

02:06.670 --> 02:08.231
So we got, we got a lot of that.

02:08.731 --> 02:16.998
And, and so we thought we would kind of cover that story a little bit, but also to try and kind of explain a little more deeply what the, what the controversy is.

02:18.439 --> 02:23.684
So, let's talk about, let's talk about planets.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.787
What's the story so far with Pluto?

02:28.868 --> 02:36.936
Well, so Pluto was discovered while back by a guy by the name of Claude Tombaugh working out at Lowell Observatory.

02:37.356 --> 02:41.620
Little tiny Spud hanging out in the edge of the universe and for a while it was the biggest thing out there.

02:42.728 --> 02:49.074
Then came the announcement of this critter called 2003 UB313, which is bigger than Pluto.

02:49.974 --> 02:52.997
And everyone in the media went, ooh, do we have a tenth planet?

02:53.818 --> 02:58.862
And the astronomers went, oh no, if there's one bigger, there's probably a lot that are bigger.

02:59.282 --> 03:02.825
And people have been wondering for a while, is Pluto a quaper belt object?

03:03.186 --> 03:03.546
Is it

03:03.982 --> 03:04.483
a planet?

03:04.763 --> 03:05.563
Is it both?

03:05.684 --> 03:07.625
Do we need to rethink how we name things?

03:09.066 --> 03:12.469
So we had to come up with a definition for a planet.

03:13.410 --> 03:17.313
Defining things is really hard, and there's a lot of history involved in this.

03:18.594 --> 03:21.877
So what is a corporate belt object?

03:22.037 --> 03:23.539
It's probably a good place to start.

03:25.020 --> 03:31.044
out in the edge of our solar system that we can see with our regular telescopes.

03:31.125 --> 03:36.329
We can look out there, and there's this big planet, Neptune, hanging out in a slightly elliptical orbit.

03:37.069 --> 03:48.138
And all around it are these proto-commit objects, quiper belt objects, that occasionally get knocked into the inner solar system and become our short period comets.

03:49.138 --> 04:04.310
And hanging out in the midst of all of these proto-short period comet objects are bigger objects like Pluto and it's either Moon or some people said it's binary planet object, Chiron.

04:05.471 --> 04:09.916
And their orbit is no different than all these other proto-common objects.

04:10.756 --> 04:12.338
It cuts across Neptune.

04:12.558 --> 04:13.799
It's highly elliptical.

04:13.979 --> 04:17.483
It goes on this weird diagonal through the plane of the solar system.

04:17.583 --> 04:19.384
It's not like any of the other planets.

04:20.786 --> 04:23.088
Seeing just how odd it was, you have to question.

04:23.929 --> 04:25.130
It's just like Sesame Street.

04:25.190 --> 04:26.851
Which of these objects doesn't belong?

04:27.092 --> 04:28.313
Does Pluto belong or not?

04:29.517 --> 04:42.971
But if I recall that the controversy's been been happening for quite a few years now, it's not like, you know, with the discovery of UB313 that people said, oh, no, now Pluto, now it really calls it into question.

04:42.991 --> 04:49.598
I mean, I know that even in the last four or five years, people have been wandering whether Pluto should be removed.

04:50.871 --> 04:55.115
Well, ever since we started finding these quiper belt objects, this question has been around.

04:55.255 --> 05:03.141
The smaller quiper belt objects started to show up in the early 90s, and they all had these similar orbits.

05:04.182 --> 05:08.626
And quiper belt objects were originally suggested back in, I believe, the 60s.

05:09.463 --> 05:16.168
So short period comets had to come from somewhere where they came from appeared to be coincident with Pluto.

05:16.768 --> 05:28.236
And if Pluto shares its orbit with a whole bunch of other objects, how is it any different from the really big asteroid series that shares its orbit with a whole bunch of asteroids?

05:28.877 --> 05:31.338
So the debate's been around for a long time.

05:31.579 --> 05:35.762
And the International Astronomical Union, which is the

05:36.842 --> 05:45.167
naming organization, the definition-making organization of the entire astronomical community, put together a working group.

05:46.287 --> 05:51.090
And that working group has been trying for a long time to try and figure out how to define a planet.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.971
And it just all came to a head this summer.

05:53.671 --> 05:55.732
So the debate's been around for a while.

05:56.873 --> 05:57.653
What do we do?

05:57.754 --> 05:59.494
Do we call series a planet?

06:00.875 --> 06:02.416
How do we lump everything together?

06:02.556 --> 06:10.582
So it all starts to come down to what makes one object different from another object, and how do the orbits plane to all of this?

06:11.563 --> 06:13.924
And where do we put the cutting-off point for a planet?

06:15.225 --> 06:24.231
Right, and I guess the discovery of UB313 something larger than Pluto that kind of brings the discussion to a head.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.993
So how did it kind of all go down this summer?

06:28.308 --> 06:29.509
Well, there's a lot of debates.

06:29.969 --> 06:35.734
There was initially the suggestion, well, why don't we call all these big objects planet?

06:36.194 --> 06:39.197
Why don't we make UB313 a planet?

06:39.297 --> 06:44.581
Why don't we make Pluto and its moon co-object Chirona planet?

06:44.982 --> 06:46.423
Why don't we make series a planet?

06:46.763 --> 06:50.106
Well, how could you make Pluto and Chirona planet?

06:50.126 --> 06:51.367
I mean, is it one and moon or the other?

06:52.372 --> 06:57.376
Well, they both orbit a point that's between them.

06:57.696 --> 07:02.140
Pluto goes in a small circle around a point outside of its body.

07:03.101 --> 07:06.603
And Sharon also goes around the same point as at a larger distance.

07:07.184 --> 07:10.386
So it's more of a binary system, just like we have binary stars.

07:10.586 --> 07:14.349
We also have Pluto and Sharon, which are binary to one another.

07:14.409 --> 07:18.793
So they co-orbit a central point that is outside of Pluto.

07:19.631 --> 07:20.031
Oh, okay.

07:20.051 --> 07:24.895
And so the central point between, say, the earth and the moon is actually inside the earth, right?

07:25.275 --> 07:25.996
Inside the earth.

07:26.276 --> 07:29.138
So the moon is clearly going around and around the earth.

07:29.358 --> 07:35.222
Whereas Sharon and Pluto, they go around a point external to both of them.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.623
So it's a binary system.

07:36.743 --> 07:38.465
So they can be binary planets.

07:38.845 --> 07:39.886
But are they planets?

07:41.087 --> 07:44.309
And so there was an initial talk.

07:44.409 --> 07:45.890
Do we make all these things planets?

07:46.230 --> 07:48.612
Do we suddenly make the solar system much bigger?

07:49.085 --> 07:51.571
And anything new that fits that criteria as well.

07:52.353 --> 07:55.480
And anything new that fits that criteria also becomes a planet.

07:55.851 --> 08:00.174
Well, if we could have 100 planets, a thousand planets, just go on and on and on.

08:00.954 --> 08:01.575
Exactly.

08:01.595 --> 08:02.576
Yeah, that went over well.

08:03.776 --> 08:04.177
Not really.

08:06.178 --> 08:09.320
So it was sort of decided, no, that doesn't work.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.401
Let's come up with something different.

08:11.541 --> 08:25.551
So let's start thinking about what are the common traits of our definite planets, the things that we know for certain we want to call a planet, like Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, these

08:26.451 --> 08:32.735
nice fairly large objects, things that basically no question.

08:34.876 --> 08:39.178
So we start looking, what are the general traits of a planet?

08:39.438 --> 08:40.659
Well, there's spheres.

08:41.699 --> 08:44.000
This eliminates Sirus from being a moon.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.341
It's not round.

08:45.861 --> 08:49.243
It's gravitational self-gravity is such that

08:50.191 --> 08:51.591
It can be lumpy and bumpy.

08:51.991 --> 09:02.153
And as the gravity of the entire asteroid pulls all the pieces together, it's not strong enough to smooth everything into a nice round sphere.

09:03.053 --> 09:09.895
Scientifically, what we say is its self-gravity can't overcome rigid body forces, big mountains, big lumps.

09:09.975 --> 09:16.716
They stay there, such that it doesn't assume a nearly round shape because it's an hydrostatic equilibrium.

09:16.836 --> 09:18.156
So we tossed serous.

09:18.496 --> 09:30.278
Right, I've heard that Mount Everest here on Earth, for example, is the maximum size you can have a mountain and that any larger is just getting smashed or squished at the bottom as fast as it's growing on the top.

09:31.303 --> 09:33.824
And this is because we have a large planet.

09:34.064 --> 09:37.605
It squishes large mountains and makes them just not get any bigger.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.986
If you go to Mars, which is a smaller planet, you can get bigger mountains.

09:42.166 --> 09:48.968
Olympus Mons on Mars is much bigger than Mount Everest because the self-gravity of Mars is lower than the self-gravity of Earth.

09:50.209 --> 09:53.369
Serious, the self-gravity just isn't enough to make it a sphere.

09:53.609 --> 09:54.690
So not a planet.

09:54.770 --> 09:55.690
Okay, but I got a wrench for you.

09:55.730 --> 09:58.611
Isn't Saturn a kind of squished ball?

09:59.798 --> 10:04.531
Well, there's a difference between a squished ball and a potato.

10:06.044 --> 10:07.405
all the planets are squished balls.

10:07.906 --> 10:13.050
You take something that's spherical and you spin it and it's going to flatten.

10:13.811 --> 10:14.952
You spin it too flat.

10:15.692 --> 10:17.334
You spin it too fast rather.

10:17.634 --> 10:18.555
It becomes a pancake.

10:19.796 --> 10:24.160
None of our planets are spinning that fast, which is good because they'd probably fall apart.

10:26.101 --> 10:33.628
But Saturn, Jupiter, even our Sun is a slightly squished ball because they're rotating and this causes the center to bow out.

10:35.890 --> 10:41.695
It's the same principle that when you're on a merry-go-round that's going way too fast, you want to fly off the edge.

10:41.875 --> 10:46.119
The equators of the planet want to fly out, but gravity holds them in.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.441
Okay, so smooth.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.582
We've got a smooth ball.

10:50.242 --> 10:50.823
Smooth ball.

10:51.083 --> 10:51.844
That's our first one.

10:52.664 --> 10:58.229
So the next characteristic we look at is, so is it orbiting something else?

10:58.869 --> 11:04.014
We have these giant moons that are in fact much bigger than Pluto.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.903
Why don't we call the giant moons of Jupiter planets?

11:09.243 --> 11:13.667
Some of them have all the characteristics that we're used to seeing in planets, volcanism.

11:13.787 --> 11:16.630
They, in some cases, appear to have liquid water.

11:16.670 --> 11:17.771
They have atmospheres.

11:18.331 --> 11:21.393
But there's satellites of another object.

11:22.214 --> 11:26.298
So a planet cannot be the satellite of another object.

11:26.398 --> 11:30.641
It has to be orbiting the sun as it's primary thing that it's orbiting.

11:31.102 --> 11:33.944
So planets are things that orbit stars.

11:34.471 --> 11:39.674
So even though Titan is large and smooth, it's out.

11:40.414 --> 11:41.695
Because it goes out.

11:41.735 --> 11:42.836
Because it goes around Saturn.

11:43.476 --> 11:44.237
It is a moon.

11:45.317 --> 11:54.783
Or in this case, when we're talking about going around, it means that the center point that the two are orbiting is inside Saturn.

11:54.823 --> 11:55.463
So it doesn't count.

11:56.244 --> 11:56.724
Exactly.

11:56.804 --> 12:00.406
But it must be just like a teeny-weeny bit away from the center of Saturn.

12:01.201 --> 12:11.164
Yeah, it's whenever you get more than one body, they end up not orbiting the true center of an object, but some point that's the gravitational center of the two objects.

12:11.184 --> 12:13.565
This is how we're able to find extra solar planets.

12:13.745 --> 12:15.226
Planets pull on stars.

12:15.506 --> 12:19.847
So stars are actually orbiting some point that's inside of them.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.968
Okay, so we've got smooth balls.

12:23.048 --> 12:28.650
We've got only orbiting the star, not orbiting some other object.

12:29.491 --> 12:30.451
And then what's the third?

12:31.667 --> 12:37.069
So next we look around and see, okay, what's hanging out around the object in question?

12:38.249 --> 12:45.852
Big planets, even some of the smaller ones like, say, Earth, we have our orbits pretty much to ourselves.

12:46.493 --> 12:57.837
As the Earth swings around the sun every year, we do cross things in our paths, comets that go through the orbit of the Earth tend to leave dirt behind, and when we collide with this, we get meteor showers.

12:59.237 --> 13:09.521
But more or less, the orb of the Earth is a nice, big, empty area that occasionally gets crossed by the orbits of asteroids or comets, but nothing lives in our orbit.

13:09.661 --> 13:14.323
We have our orbit to ourselves, other things pass through, but they don't stay there.

13:15.384 --> 13:16.684
If they do stay there, we eat them.

13:17.625 --> 13:20.046
Hopefully, without too much destruction to our planet.

13:22.727 --> 13:24.168
Or veer them off into space.

13:25.349 --> 13:28.170
We're not quite sure how to do that yet, but it's a good goal.

13:30.352 --> 13:38.296
So when you look around the orbit of an object, you look to see is the orbit empty of other stuff.

13:38.677 --> 13:40.718
This implies that while the planet was forming,

13:41.638 --> 13:58.127
It ate up all the material in its orbital path, made it part of itself, or through interactions flung it into other parts of the solar system, and thus the planet lives in an area of the solar system that has been cleared out.

13:59.788 --> 14:01.709
This is where Pluto gets itself into trouble.

14:02.750 --> 14:07.533
Pluto is in a three to two orbital resonance with Neptune.

14:08.053 --> 14:12.897
This means that for every three times Neptune goes around the Sun, it goes around twice.

14:13.457 --> 14:15.558
And there's a whole lot of things that do that.

14:16.619 --> 14:19.441
A whole class of objects that do this.

14:21.674 --> 14:26.818
Oh, sorry, but Pluto and Neptune aren't actually in the same orbit, right?

14:26.858 --> 14:35.265
Like Pluto has this kind of elliptical orbit that's kind of inclined off the plane and kind of zooms in past Neptune and then back out again, right?

14:36.684 --> 14:42.067
Exactly, but Pluto crosses through that orbit, and it's not the only thing crossing through Neptune's orbit.

14:42.647 --> 14:51.032
There are a whole lot of different objects that are all crossing back and forth through Neptune's orbit.

14:51.072 --> 14:51.572
These are

14:52.072 --> 14:58.734
transneptunian objects, and the ones that share Pluto's type of orbit are called Plutinos.

15:00.174 --> 15:03.275
So Pluto isn't orbiting by itself.

15:03.415 --> 15:08.196
It's sharing its orbit with a whole bunch of other little objects, and in some cases bigger objects.

15:08.556 --> 15:12.937
So are these objects that are also kind of locked into that same orbital resonance with Neptune?

15:13.789 --> 15:17.571
Yes, these are all objects that have a three to two resonance with Neptune.

15:18.571 --> 15:19.552
These are called Plutinos.

15:20.672 --> 15:23.714
And so Pluto is not unique.

15:23.894 --> 15:28.076
It's in a class of orbits with a whole bunch of other objects.

15:28.877 --> 15:31.238
It's just the biggest one we've found so far.

15:32.238 --> 15:39.083
It's a fairly reflective object, so it reflects lots of light from the sun back to where we can observe it here on Earth.

15:39.883 --> 15:46.268
We've detected it, but who's to say there isn't a really dirty Pluto out there that we just haven't detected yet?

15:47.188 --> 15:49.970
There's lots of smaller stuff that we've already found in that orbit.

15:51.531 --> 15:57.215
So here's where the IAU kicks Pluto out of planet classification.

15:57.984 --> 16:03.337
The definition now says it has to have cleared its orbital neighborhood of other stuff.

16:03.878 --> 16:07.226
And Pluto's orbit is jam packed with other stuff.

16:08.007 --> 16:14.531
Now, I've heard that people, obviously this didn't go well for a lot of Pluto fans.

16:15.972 --> 16:35.603
And from what I've heard, a lot of people saying, well, it's that third definition that's really the kicker because there are a lot of other planets that do other objects in their same orbit, like there's a series of asteroids that go before and after Jupiter, for example, in its orbit.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.781
Yeah, these are the Trojan asteroids.

16:38.101 --> 16:53.932
So what happens is as things go flying through the universe and specifically flying through our solar system, they interact with other bodies, and over time where they started isn't necessarily where they ended up.

16:54.852 --> 16:56.713
And Jupiter has a lot of gravity.

16:57.014 --> 17:00.476
It's other than the sun, the largest thing in our solar system.

17:01.477 --> 17:04.899
And it tends to capture asteroids and comets in

17:05.479 --> 17:06.880
what are called Lagrange points.

17:07.020 --> 17:19.708
These are places where objects can get trapped so that they're gravitationally balanced between Jupiter and the Sun and basically co-orbit with Jupiter, either leading it or trailing it.

17:20.889 --> 17:23.490
But these objects didn't necessarily form in those orbits.

17:23.930 --> 17:26.471
They probably got captured and got stuck there.

17:27.551 --> 17:30.833
We tend to stick satellites in the Lagrange points of the Earth.

17:31.053 --> 17:36.995
It's just a nice happy place to stick objects in their fairly stable, depending on which Lagrange points you stick them in.

17:38.075 --> 17:42.658
So when you look at Jupiter, you're not looking at stuff that hasn't been cleared out of Jupiter's orbit.

17:42.778 --> 17:45.999
You're looking at stuff that has been trapped in Jupiter's orbit.

17:46.800 --> 17:57.546
So there's a difference between not clearing your orbit and clearing your orbit and then deciding you're going to gravitationally grab some junk and trap it there.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.428
And that's what we're looking at when we look at the Trojan asteroids.

18:02.308 --> 18:16.873
So now, with this definition of planethood, if we do find a large planet further out past, you know, past UB313, that fulfills that requirement, then they would necessarily have to call it a planet again.

18:16.913 --> 18:18.173
So we might get nine planets again.

18:18.193 --> 18:20.414
But I'm- It's possible to have nine planets, yeah.

18:20.794 --> 18:29.217
But then I'm wondering what, how this definition, is this just for the solar system or does this definition work with extra solar planetary systems as well?

18:29.878 --> 18:35.342
Well, it should work with extra solar system, extra solar planetary systems.

18:35.723 --> 18:45.630
The catch is going to be being flexible because as we look at other stars, currently we can't see everything that is orbiting a particular star.

18:45.690 --> 18:52.115
We're able to pick up the giant planets, the things that are Jupiter mass, fairly consistently.

18:52.776 --> 18:56.018
There's over 2,000 known extra solar planets, not 2,200 extra solar planets at this point.

18:59.941 --> 19:02.103
And we're slowly starting to find the small stuff.

19:03.104 --> 19:10.191
And as we look at other stars, we're seeing discs around them when they're young and still forming.

19:10.471 --> 19:17.418
And in several cases, we can actually see cleared out regions in these dust discs that we believe are places

19:17.918 --> 19:21.519
where a planet is forming and has already cleared out its orbital path.

19:22.079 --> 19:27.640
So when we find that object in that cleared out area of the dust disk, that's a planet.

19:28.541 --> 19:41.404
But when we start finding things using perhaps gravitational micro-lensing technique where a star will pass in front of a background star and

19:41.984 --> 19:53.508
Its gravity will cause light that would otherwise shoot off to some other part of the galaxy to get bent back towards us, thus increasing the amount of light in total that we're able to see here on Earth.

19:54.149 --> 20:10.835
Well, when this happens and there's a planet involved, that planet's gravity also gets in on the bending light activity, and we're able to detect smaller planets this way through their gravitational interactions with objects further off in the galaxy.

20:11.295 --> 20:15.958
Yeah, with the traditional methods, we can only find them a few hundred light years away.

20:16.238 --> 20:22.202
And I know that with this someone saw found a planet using gravitational microlensing like 10,000 light years away.

20:22.783 --> 20:37.612
Yeah, it's one of these fascinating new techniques that gravity is a powerful thing and it's allowing us to make powerful measurements of little tiny planets or at least 14 earth mass planets out further out in the galaxy.

20:37.632 --> 20:40.194
The only problem is as we can't confirm these discoveries.

20:41.154 --> 20:52.586
gravitational lensing events, you see them and then they're over and you don't get a second shot, but it will help us determine the frequency at which these planets are out there.

20:53.147 --> 21:02.437
But since we only get one shot and we can't go back and look for additional objects in the same orbits, who's to say there aren't a bunch of

21:03.718 --> 21:15.614
I don't think this is rational, but who's to say there aren't a bunch of 14 earth mass planets and the exact same orbit, in which case they're no longer planets because they haven't cleared their orbit?

21:16.835 --> 21:17.957
So we have to be flexible.

21:17.997 --> 21:20.240
We have to be willing to say, well, we think it's a planet.

21:20.620 --> 21:27.808
But we haven't fully explored that extra solar solar system to see what all is in it.

21:28.248 --> 21:37.238
So the definition should stand, but we need to recognize that what may be a planet today, tomorrow we may realize is not really a planet.

21:38.206 --> 21:43.748
Well, I don't know whether the Pluto fans are going to take this line down.

21:43.768 --> 21:53.633
I know that already there are petitions in the works to try and get the IAU to overturn the decision soon or at least by the time of its next meeting.

21:53.653 --> 22:07.459
I know there was a very low, actually a very low turnout at the meeting, and I think something like only 5% of the people at the meeting actually voted for the, or 5% of people in the international astronomical union voted for

22:07.779 --> 22:12.941
for this book-changing definition.

22:13.461 --> 22:17.083
Well, part of the problem was, is the final vote ended up happening on the last day.

22:17.103 --> 22:26.726
And anyone who's gone to a big conference knows that the last day is often the day during which a lot of people have had to catch planes and they're just not there anymore.

22:28.347 --> 22:35.410
There's also a vested interest in this for every elementary school teacher who doesn't have the budget to buy new textbooks.

22:36.491 --> 22:44.118
Um, there's a vested interest in all the poster makers who've already made 10,000 posters showing Pluto as a planet.

22:44.638 --> 22:46.300
Walt Disney is going to be mad.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.341
Walt Disney.

22:47.501 --> 22:49.343
Oh, that poor pseudo dog.

22:49.683 --> 22:50.965
Yeah.

22:51.105 --> 22:52.766
He's never been given any respect.

22:52.946 --> 22:55.589
And now he's not even named after a planet.

22:55.669 --> 22:57.671
He's named after a dwarf planet.

23:00.165 --> 23:00.525
Perfect.

23:01.486 --> 23:01.786
Great.

23:01.826 --> 23:11.453
Well, that was all I think all we needed to know about Pluto and its unplanetating, its replaneting, and then its unplanetating.

23:12.854 --> 23:21.881
And maybe if Pluto becomes a planet again, or if there's anything new in the dwarf planet news, we'll bring that back up.

23:21.921 --> 23:22.941
Now, where are you now?

23:24.632 --> 23:28.275
I'm at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, Illinois.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.717
It's right across the river from the city of St.

23:31.757 --> 23:32.878
Louis in Missouri.

23:33.038 --> 23:41.363
So it's the land of bluffs, corn, tornadoes, and a really pretty little town with a nice little state university.

23:42.144 --> 23:44.846
And your teaching astronomy there?

23:45.806 --> 23:48.608
This semester, I'm actually not teaching astronomy.

23:48.728 --> 23:51.730
I'm teaching space physics, which we're focusing on orbits.

23:53.743 --> 23:57.604
I'm teaching physics for pre-meds because doctors need to know physics too.

23:59.305 --> 23:59.645
Awesome.

23:59.725 --> 24:08.708
Okay, so now you can find our show at astronomycast.com and you can send us some email if you want.

24:08.788 --> 24:11.709
Any questions, comments, or feedback, please go gentle on us.

24:11.729 --> 24:14.690
This is the first time we're still trying to get into our groove.

24:14.710 --> 24:17.992
I'm sure by show 100, we'll be very smooth.

24:18.672 --> 24:21.733
But right now we're very stilted and we'll get better.

24:22.493 --> 24:26.155
But anyway, you can send us an email at infoatastronomycast.com.

24:27.415 --> 24:42.242
And if you send us an email, maybe with a question, then maybe Pamela can have a run at it, or maybe we'll seek outside and find a bigger brain and maybe talk to some other professional astronomers and get some answers for people.

24:44.023 --> 24:58.029
Now this, for people who may know, I run the website Universe today and I run a fairly large discussion forum with my good friend Dr. Phil Plait and so who runs Bad Astronomy.

24:58.149 --> 25:04.131
And so our forum together is the Bad Astronomy Universe today forum or boutforum.com.

25:04.251 --> 25:08.073
And so we're going to tie in the comments from

25:08.793 --> 25:11.475
for astronomy cast into that forum as well.

25:11.575 --> 25:24.205
So, if you've never been there, you get a chance to sign up and then you can join the conversation about this show, but you can also talk about other space and astronomy stuff with a fairly large community of people.

25:25.805 --> 25:33.667
And other than that, I think thank you very much for listening for me, for Dr. Pamela Gay.

25:33.887 --> 25:42.329
Hopefully we can explain the universe to you a week after week, and we appreciate you taking the time to listen to us.

25:45.670 --> 25:49.571
This has been AstronomyCast, a weekly fact-space journey through the cosmos.

25:50.291 --> 25:51.852
Music provided by Travis Sur.

25:52.252 --> 25:53.012
Thanks for listening.
