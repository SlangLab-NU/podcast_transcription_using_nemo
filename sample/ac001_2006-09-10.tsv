6260	9281	Astronomycast, episode one for Monday, September 11, 2006.
11401	12862	Pluto and Planethood.
15622	17363	Welcome to the Astronomycast.
17443	21604	My name is Fraser Cain and I am the Webmaster of Universe today.
21624	28645	And I also have with me Pamela Gay, also from Slacker Astronomy fame.
29326	31026	And are you there, Pamela?
31830	32351	I am here.
32651	33091	All right.
33872	35893	I wasn't sure I'd be talking to myself but no that's good.
37895	44880	So we're our hope with this brand new show and you'll have to you know watch us as we go through our teething pain.
44900	56449	As our hope is to cover some of the latest highlights in astronomy news but more did kind of deeper into the background and
57149	62814	sort of the underlying explanations of the world of astronomy, a universe of astronomy.
63775	71482	And so not just kind of like what's been discovered, what's going on, but actually to say, you know, like how do we know what we know?
72182	73964	and trying to get some underlying explanations.
74004	90157	And hopefully week after week as we build up an archive of shows, people can kind of look back and when they know about, say, black holes or dark matter, they can listen to some of our shows on those exact subjects and really kind of understand the subject matter a little better.
90177	92039	Do you agree, Pamela?
92808	93929	I totally agree.
94009	106378	We're going to follow the facts through the cosmos and find out where the facts lead us and look at what the facts were initially, what we thought initially and what we know now and what we think these facts that we know now tell us.
107355	115181	So if we, if we talk to any astronomer, anyone in the space industry this last couple of months and said, you know, look, what's the, what's the hot story?
116102	117923	They'll all tell us it's Pluto.
118023	118924	Pluto, Pluto, Pluto.
119404	122507	In fact, you know, every question that I got was about Pluto.
122547	123908	Pluto, a planet is not a planet.
124208	124909	What does that mean?
125489	125769	What's it?
125869	126550	What is a planet?
126670	128231	So we got, we got a lot of that.
128731	136998	And, and so we thought we would kind of cover that story a little bit, but also to try and kind of explain a little more deeply what the, what the controversy is.
138439	143684	So, let's talk about, let's talk about planets.
144645	147787	What's the story so far with Pluto?
148868	156936	Well, so Pluto was discovered while back by a guy by the name of Claude Tombaugh working out at Lowell Observatory.
157356	161620	Little tiny Spud hanging out in the edge of the universe and for a while it was the biggest thing out there.
162728	169074	Then came the announcement of this critter called 2003 UB313, which is bigger than Pluto.
169974	172997	And everyone in the media went, ooh, do we have a tenth planet?
173818	178862	And the astronomers went, oh no, if there's one bigger, there's probably a lot that are bigger.
179282	182825	And people have been wondering for a while, is Pluto a quaper belt object?
183186	183546	Is it
183982	184483	a planet?
184763	185563	Is it both?
185684	187625	Do we need to rethink how we name things?
189066	192469	So we had to come up with a definition for a planet.
193410	197313	Defining things is really hard, and there's a lot of history involved in this.
198594	201877	So what is a corporate belt object?
202037	203539	It's probably a good place to start.
205020	211044	out in the edge of our solar system that we can see with our regular telescopes.
211125	216329	We can look out there, and there's this big planet, Neptune, hanging out in a slightly elliptical orbit.
217069	228138	And all around it are these proto-commit objects, quiper belt objects, that occasionally get knocked into the inner solar system and become our short period comets.
229138	244310	And hanging out in the midst of all of these proto-short period comet objects are bigger objects like Pluto and it's either Moon or some people said it's binary planet object, Chiron.
245471	249916	And their orbit is no different than all these other proto-common objects.
250756	252338	It cuts across Neptune.
252558	253799	It's highly elliptical.
253979	257483	It goes on this weird diagonal through the plane of the solar system.
257583	259384	It's not like any of the other planets.
260786	263088	Seeing just how odd it was, you have to question.
263929	265130	It's just like Sesame Street.
265190	266851	Which of these objects doesn't belong?
267092	268313	Does Pluto belong or not?
269517	282971	But if I recall that the controversy's been been happening for quite a few years now, it's not like, you know, with the discovery of UB313 that people said, oh, no, now Pluto, now it really calls it into question.
282991	289598	I mean, I know that even in the last four or five years, people have been wandering whether Pluto should be removed.
290871	295115	Well, ever since we started finding these quiper belt objects, this question has been around.
295255	303141	The smaller quiper belt objects started to show up in the early 90s, and they all had these similar orbits.
304182	308626	And quiper belt objects were originally suggested back in, I believe, the 60s.
309463	316168	So short period comets had to come from somewhere where they came from appeared to be coincident with Pluto.
316768	328236	And if Pluto shares its orbit with a whole bunch of other objects, how is it any different from the really big asteroid series that shares its orbit with a whole bunch of asteroids?
328877	331338	So the debate's been around for a long time.
331579	335762	And the International Astronomical Union, which is the
336842	345167	naming organization, the definition-making organization of the entire astronomical community, put together a working group.
346287	351090	And that working group has been trying for a long time to try and figure out how to define a planet.
351150	352971	And it just all came to a head this summer.
353671	355732	So the debate's been around for a while.
356873	357653	What do we do?
357754	359494	Do we call series a planet?
360875	362416	How do we lump everything together?
362556	370582	So it all starts to come down to what makes one object different from another object, and how do the orbits plane to all of this?
371563	373924	And where do we put the cutting-off point for a planet?
375225	384231	Right, and I guess the discovery of UB313 something larger than Pluto that kind of brings the discussion to a head.
384451	386993	So how did it kind of all go down this summer?
388308	389509	Well, there's a lot of debates.
389969	395734	There was initially the suggestion, well, why don't we call all these big objects planet?
396194	399197	Why don't we make UB313 a planet?
399297	404581	Why don't we make Pluto and its moon co-object Chirona planet?
404982	406423	Why don't we make series a planet?
406763	410106	Well, how could you make Pluto and Chirona planet?
410126	411367	I mean, is it one and moon or the other?
412372	417376	Well, they both orbit a point that's between them.
417696	422140	Pluto goes in a small circle around a point outside of its body.
423101	426603	And Sharon also goes around the same point as at a larger distance.
427184	430386	So it's more of a binary system, just like we have binary stars.
430586	434349	We also have Pluto and Sharon, which are binary to one another.
434409	438793	So they co-orbit a central point that is outside of Pluto.
439631	440031	Oh, okay.
440051	444895	And so the central point between, say, the earth and the moon is actually inside the earth, right?
445275	445996	Inside the earth.
446276	449138	So the moon is clearly going around and around the earth.
449358	455222	Whereas Sharon and Pluto, they go around a point external to both of them.
455422	456623	So it's a binary system.
456743	458465	So they can be binary planets.
458845	459886	But are they planets?
461087	464309	And so there was an initial talk.
464409	465890	Do we make all these things planets?
466230	468612	Do we suddenly make the solar system much bigger?
469085	471571	And anything new that fits that criteria as well.
472353	475480	And anything new that fits that criteria also becomes a planet.
475851	480174	Well, if we could have 100 planets, a thousand planets, just go on and on and on.
480954	481575	Exactly.
481595	482576	Yeah, that went over well.
483776	484177	Not really.
486178	489320	So it was sort of decided, no, that doesn't work.
489420	491401	Let's come up with something different.
491541	505551	So let's start thinking about what are the common traits of our definite planets, the things that we know for certain we want to call a planet, like Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, these
506451	512735	nice fairly large objects, things that basically no question.
514876	519178	So we start looking, what are the general traits of a planet?
519438	520659	Well, there's spheres.
521699	524000	This eliminates Sirus from being a moon.
524280	525341	It's not round.
525861	529243	It's gravitational self-gravity is such that
530191	531591	It can be lumpy and bumpy.
531991	542153	And as the gravity of the entire asteroid pulls all the pieces together, it's not strong enough to smooth everything into a nice round sphere.
543053	549895	Scientifically, what we say is its self-gravity can't overcome rigid body forces, big mountains, big lumps.
549975	556716	They stay there, such that it doesn't assume a nearly round shape because it's an hydrostatic equilibrium.
556836	558156	So we tossed serous.
558496	570278	Right, I've heard that Mount Everest here on Earth, for example, is the maximum size you can have a mountain and that any larger is just getting smashed or squished at the bottom as fast as it's growing on the top.
571303	573824	And this is because we have a large planet.
574064	577605	It squishes large mountains and makes them just not get any bigger.
577785	581986	If you go to Mars, which is a smaller planet, you can get bigger mountains.
582166	588968	Olympus Mons on Mars is much bigger than Mount Everest because the self-gravity of Mars is lower than the self-gravity of Earth.
590209	593369	Serious, the self-gravity just isn't enough to make it a sphere.
593609	594690	So not a planet.
594770	595690	Okay, but I got a wrench for you.
595730	598611	Isn't Saturn a kind of squished ball?
599798	604531	Well, there's a difference between a squished ball and a potato.
606044	607405	all the planets are squished balls.
607906	613050	You take something that's spherical and you spin it and it's going to flatten.
613811	614952	You spin it too flat.
615692	617334	You spin it too fast rather.
617634	618555	It becomes a pancake.
619796	624160	None of our planets are spinning that fast, which is good because they'd probably fall apart.
626101	633628	But Saturn, Jupiter, even our Sun is a slightly squished ball because they're rotating and this causes the center to bow out.
635890	641695	It's the same principle that when you're on a merry-go-round that's going way too fast, you want to fly off the edge.
641875	646119	The equators of the planet want to fly out, but gravity holds them in.
646579	648441	Okay, so smooth.
648481	649582	We've got a smooth ball.
650242	650823	Smooth ball.
651083	651844	That's our first one.
652664	658229	So the next characteristic we look at is, so is it orbiting something else?
658869	664014	We have these giant moons that are in fact much bigger than Pluto.
665200	668903	Why don't we call the giant moons of Jupiter planets?
669243	673667	Some of them have all the characteristics that we're used to seeing in planets, volcanism.
673787	676630	They, in some cases, appear to have liquid water.
676670	677771	They have atmospheres.
678331	681393	But there's satellites of another object.
682214	686298	So a planet cannot be the satellite of another object.
686398	690641	It has to be orbiting the sun as it's primary thing that it's orbiting.
691102	693944	So planets are things that orbit stars.
694471	699674	So even though Titan is large and smooth, it's out.
700414	701695	Because it goes out.
701735	702836	Because it goes around Saturn.
703476	704237	It is a moon.
705317	714783	Or in this case, when we're talking about going around, it means that the center point that the two are orbiting is inside Saturn.
714823	715463	So it doesn't count.
716244	716724	Exactly.
716804	720406	But it must be just like a teeny-weeny bit away from the center of Saturn.
721201	731164	Yeah, it's whenever you get more than one body, they end up not orbiting the true center of an object, but some point that's the gravitational center of the two objects.
731184	733565	This is how we're able to find extra solar planets.
733745	735226	Planets pull on stars.
735506	739847	So stars are actually orbiting some point that's inside of them.
740908	742968	Okay, so we've got smooth balls.
743048	748650	We've got only orbiting the star, not orbiting some other object.
749491	750451	And then what's the third?
751667	757069	So next we look around and see, okay, what's hanging out around the object in question?
758249	765852	Big planets, even some of the smaller ones like, say, Earth, we have our orbits pretty much to ourselves.
766493	777837	As the Earth swings around the sun every year, we do cross things in our paths, comets that go through the orbit of the Earth tend to leave dirt behind, and when we collide with this, we get meteor showers.
779237	789521	But more or less, the orb of the Earth is a nice, big, empty area that occasionally gets crossed by the orbits of asteroids or comets, but nothing lives in our orbit.
789661	794323	We have our orbit to ourselves, other things pass through, but they don't stay there.
795384	796684	If they do stay there, we eat them.
797625	800046	Hopefully, without too much destruction to our planet.
802727	804168	Or veer them off into space.
805349	808170	We're not quite sure how to do that yet, but it's a good goal.
810352	818296	So when you look around the orbit of an object, you look to see is the orbit empty of other stuff.
818677	820718	This implies that while the planet was forming,
821638	838127	It ate up all the material in its orbital path, made it part of itself, or through interactions flung it into other parts of the solar system, and thus the planet lives in an area of the solar system that has been cleared out.
839788	841709	This is where Pluto gets itself into trouble.
842750	847533	Pluto is in a three to two orbital resonance with Neptune.
848053	852897	This means that for every three times Neptune goes around the Sun, it goes around twice.
853457	855558	And there's a whole lot of things that do that.
856619	859441	A whole class of objects that do this.
861674	866818	Oh, sorry, but Pluto and Neptune aren't actually in the same orbit, right?
866858	875265	Like Pluto has this kind of elliptical orbit that's kind of inclined off the plane and kind of zooms in past Neptune and then back out again, right?
876684	882067	Exactly, but Pluto crosses through that orbit, and it's not the only thing crossing through Neptune's orbit.
882647	891032	There are a whole lot of different objects that are all crossing back and forth through Neptune's orbit.
891072	891572	These are
892072	898734	transneptunian objects, and the ones that share Pluto's type of orbit are called Plutinos.
900174	903275	So Pluto isn't orbiting by itself.
903415	908196	It's sharing its orbit with a whole bunch of other little objects, and in some cases bigger objects.
908556	912937	So are these objects that are also kind of locked into that same orbital resonance with Neptune?
913789	917571	Yes, these are all objects that have a three to two resonance with Neptune.
918571	919552	These are called Plutinos.
920672	923714	And so Pluto is not unique.
923894	928076	It's in a class of orbits with a whole bunch of other objects.
928877	931238	It's just the biggest one we've found so far.
932238	939083	It's a fairly reflective object, so it reflects lots of light from the sun back to where we can observe it here on Earth.
939883	946268	We've detected it, but who's to say there isn't a really dirty Pluto out there that we just haven't detected yet?
947188	949970	There's lots of smaller stuff that we've already found in that orbit.
951531	957215	So here's where the IAU kicks Pluto out of planet classification.
957984	963337	The definition now says it has to have cleared its orbital neighborhood of other stuff.
963878	967226	And Pluto's orbit is jam packed with other stuff.
968007	974531	Now, I've heard that people, obviously this didn't go well for a lot of Pluto fans.
975972	995603	And from what I've heard, a lot of people saying, well, it's that third definition that's really the kicker because there are a lot of other planets that do other objects in their same orbit, like there's a series of asteroids that go before and after Jupiter, for example, in its orbit.
996280	997781	Yeah, these are the Trojan asteroids.
998101	1013932	So what happens is as things go flying through the universe and specifically flying through our solar system, they interact with other bodies, and over time where they started isn't necessarily where they ended up.
1014852	1016713	And Jupiter has a lot of gravity.
1017014	1020476	It's other than the sun, the largest thing in our solar system.
1021477	1024899	And it tends to capture asteroids and comets in
1025479	1026880	what are called Lagrange points.
1027020	1039708	These are places where objects can get trapped so that they're gravitationally balanced between Jupiter and the Sun and basically co-orbit with Jupiter, either leading it or trailing it.
1040889	1043490	But these objects didn't necessarily form in those orbits.
1043930	1046471	They probably got captured and got stuck there.
1047551	1050833	We tend to stick satellites in the Lagrange points of the Earth.
1051053	1056995	It's just a nice happy place to stick objects in their fairly stable, depending on which Lagrange points you stick them in.
1058075	1062658	So when you look at Jupiter, you're not looking at stuff that hasn't been cleared out of Jupiter's orbit.
1062778	1065999	You're looking at stuff that has been trapped in Jupiter's orbit.
1066800	1077546	So there's a difference between not clearing your orbit and clearing your orbit and then deciding you're going to gravitationally grab some junk and trap it there.
1078786	1081428	And that's what we're looking at when we look at the Trojan asteroids.
1082308	1096873	So now, with this definition of planethood, if we do find a large planet further out past, you know, past UB313, that fulfills that requirement, then they would necessarily have to call it a planet again.
1096913	1098173	So we might get nine planets again.
1098193	1100414	But I'm- It's possible to have nine planets, yeah.
1100794	1109217	But then I'm wondering what, how this definition, is this just for the solar system or does this definition work with extra solar planetary systems as well?
1109878	1115342	Well, it should work with extra solar system, extra solar planetary systems.
1115723	1125630	The catch is going to be being flexible because as we look at other stars, currently we can't see everything that is orbiting a particular star.
1125690	1132115	We're able to pick up the giant planets, the things that are Jupiter mass, fairly consistently.
1132776	1136018	There's over 2,000 known extra solar planets, not 2,200 extra solar planets at this point.
1139941	1142103	And we're slowly starting to find the small stuff.
1143104	1150191	And as we look at other stars, we're seeing discs around them when they're young and still forming.
1150471	1157418	And in several cases, we can actually see cleared out regions in these dust discs that we believe are places
1157918	1161519	where a planet is forming and has already cleared out its orbital path.
1162079	1167640	So when we find that object in that cleared out area of the dust disk, that's a planet.
1168541	1181404	But when we start finding things using perhaps gravitational micro-lensing technique where a star will pass in front of a background star and
1181984	1193508	Its gravity will cause light that would otherwise shoot off to some other part of the galaxy to get bent back towards us, thus increasing the amount of light in total that we're able to see here on Earth.
1194149	1210835	Well, when this happens and there's a planet involved, that planet's gravity also gets in on the bending light activity, and we're able to detect smaller planets this way through their gravitational interactions with objects further off in the galaxy.
1211295	1215958	Yeah, with the traditional methods, we can only find them a few hundred light years away.
1216238	1222202	And I know that with this someone saw found a planet using gravitational microlensing like 10,000 light years away.
1222783	1237612	Yeah, it's one of these fascinating new techniques that gravity is a powerful thing and it's allowing us to make powerful measurements of little tiny planets or at least 14 earth mass planets out further out in the galaxy.
1237632	1240194	The only problem is as we can't confirm these discoveries.
1241154	1252586	gravitational lensing events, you see them and then they're over and you don't get a second shot, but it will help us determine the frequency at which these planets are out there.
1253147	1262437	But since we only get one shot and we can't go back and look for additional objects in the same orbits, who's to say there aren't a bunch of
1263718	1275614	I don't think this is rational, but who's to say there aren't a bunch of 14 earth mass planets and the exact same orbit, in which case they're no longer planets because they haven't cleared their orbit?
1276835	1277957	So we have to be flexible.
1277997	1280240	We have to be willing to say, well, we think it's a planet.
1280620	1287808	But we haven't fully explored that extra solar solar system to see what all is in it.
1288248	1297238	So the definition should stand, but we need to recognize that what may be a planet today, tomorrow we may realize is not really a planet.
1298206	1303748	Well, I don't know whether the Pluto fans are going to take this line down.
1303768	1313633	I know that already there are petitions in the works to try and get the IAU to overturn the decision soon or at least by the time of its next meeting.
1313653	1327459	I know there was a very low, actually a very low turnout at the meeting, and I think something like only 5% of the people at the meeting actually voted for the, or 5% of people in the international astronomical union voted for
1327779	1332941	for this book-changing definition.
1333461	1337083	Well, part of the problem was, is the final vote ended up happening on the last day.
1337103	1346726	And anyone who's gone to a big conference knows that the last day is often the day during which a lot of people have had to catch planes and they're just not there anymore.
1348347	1355410	There's also a vested interest in this for every elementary school teacher who doesn't have the budget to buy new textbooks.
1356491	1364118	Um, there's a vested interest in all the poster makers who've already made 10,000 posters showing Pluto as a planet.
1364638	1366300	Walt Disney is going to be mad.
1366800	1367341	Walt Disney.
1367501	1369343	Oh, that poor pseudo dog.
1369683	1370965	Yeah.
1371105	1372766	He's never been given any respect.
1372946	1375589	And now he's not even named after a planet.
1375669	1377671	He's named after a dwarf planet.
1380165	1380525	Perfect.
1381486	1381786	Great.
1381826	1391453	Well, that was all I think all we needed to know about Pluto and its unplanetating, its replaneting, and then its unplanetating.
1392854	1401881	And maybe if Pluto becomes a planet again, or if there's anything new in the dwarf planet news, we'll bring that back up.
1401921	1402941	Now, where are you now?
1404632	1408275	I'm at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, Illinois.
1408575	1411717	It's right across the river from the city of St.
1411757	1412878	Louis in Missouri.
1413038	1421363	So it's the land of bluffs, corn, tornadoes, and a really pretty little town with a nice little state university.
1422144	1424846	And your teaching astronomy there?
1425806	1428608	This semester, I'm actually not teaching astronomy.
1428728	1431730	I'm teaching space physics, which we're focusing on orbits.
1433743	1437604	I'm teaching physics for pre-meds because doctors need to know physics too.
1439305	1439645	Awesome.
1439725	1448708	Okay, so now you can find our show at astronomycast.com and you can send us some email if you want.
1448788	1451709	Any questions, comments, or feedback, please go gentle on us.
1451729	1454690	This is the first time we're still trying to get into our groove.
1454710	1457992	I'm sure by show 100, we'll be very smooth.
1458672	1461733	But right now we're very stilted and we'll get better.
1462493	1466155	But anyway, you can send us an email at infoatastronomycast.com.
1467415	1482242	And if you send us an email, maybe with a question, then maybe Pamela can have a run at it, or maybe we'll seek outside and find a bigger brain and maybe talk to some other professional astronomers and get some answers for people.
1484023	1498029	Now this, for people who may know, I run the website Universe today and I run a fairly large discussion forum with my good friend Dr. Phil Plait and so who runs Bad Astronomy.
1498149	1504131	And so our forum together is the Bad Astronomy Universe today forum or boutforum.com.
1504251	1508073	And so we're going to tie in the comments from
1508793	1511475	for astronomy cast into that forum as well.
1511575	1524205	So, if you've never been there, you get a chance to sign up and then you can join the conversation about this show, but you can also talk about other space and astronomy stuff with a fairly large community of people.
1525805	1533667	And other than that, I think thank you very much for listening for me, for Dr. Pamela Gay.
1533887	1542329	Hopefully we can explain the universe to you a week after week, and we appreciate you taking the time to listen to us.
1545670	1549571	This has been AstronomyCast, a weekly fact-space journey through the cosmos.
1550291	1551852	Music provided by Travis Sur.
1552252	1553012	Thanks for listening.
